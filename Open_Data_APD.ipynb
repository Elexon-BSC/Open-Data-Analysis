    "This simple script retrieves the Account Period Data for a single BSC Party and Settlement Date using a SAA-I014 text file as an input. The script is intended to be used as an example of how the SAA-I014 file can be imported and manipulated in Python using Pandas given the complex nested structure of the data. The manipulations completed below are in line with the Interface Design Document structure format of the data flow. A link to this file can be found in the accompanying Insight Article.  "
